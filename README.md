Built automated script in Google App Script to filter through responses from a New Hampshire volunteer form and save them in their respective sheet.

The form is compiled by residents of New Hampshire and neighboring states who are interested in serving as Poll Workers during the 2020 Election cycle. 
The script favors volunteers who report being lawyers or current law students, as well as those indicating their full availability on Election day.
